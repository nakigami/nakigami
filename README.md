## LLM Systems Engineer | Open-Weight AI Infrastructure | Scalable Inference & Evaluation | MLOps

I design and operate production-grade LLM systems with a strong background in distributed systems (Java / Spring Boot) and modern full-stack engineering (React / TypeScript).

My focus is building reliable, observable and scalable AI systems — from open-weight model deployment to evaluation and monitoring in production environments.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🧠 Open-weight LLM deployment (optimized inference, batching, streaming)
- 🔎 RAG systems with structured evaluation frameworks
- ⚙️ Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)
- 🔁 End-to-end MLOps pipelines (training → evaluation → deployment → monitoring)
- 📊 AI observability (latency, hallucination tracking, drift detection)
- ☁️ Cloud-native AI systems (AWS / Azure / GCP)

---

## 🧠 AI & ML Stack

### Languages
- Python (ML systems, inference, orchestration)
- Java (high-performance backend systems)
- TypeScript (AI dashboards & frontends)

### AI / ML

---

## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy

I apply software craftsmanship principles to AI systems:

- Clean Architecture for ML pipelines
- DDD applied to AI microservices
- Testable and modular LLM workflows
- Observability-first design
- Performance & cost optimization mindset

AI systems should be:
> measurable, scalable, reliable, and production-ready.
